This week I learned that a trailing comma can lead to unexpected results.

I've been working through the [Advent of Code] each night in python3. [Day 4's]
problem was the most involved so far. When I submitted part 2 I was greeted
with the all-too-familiar "_that's the wrong answer_" screen. I checked my
code, fixed up a few errors and submitted again. Wrong answer still. I scanned
through my code again. Wrote assertions for all of their tests and then I saw
it: a trailing comma turned a False value True.

```python3
>>> def f():
...     return False
...
>>> assert False
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AssertionError
>>> def g():
...     return False,
...
>>> assert g()
>>>
```

The trailing `,` turns False into (False,) -- that is, a tuple with one
element. The docs say this about truthiness.

> By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a
  `__bool__()` method that returns False or a `__len__()` method that returns
  zero, when called with the object. 1 Here are most of the built-in objects
  considered false:

Sure enough, a one-element tuple defines a `__len__()` method that returns 1.
