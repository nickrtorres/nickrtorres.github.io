This week I learned that slash chords [can be analyzed](https://youtu.be/f9eoD_dR4fA) by how the upper structure (left side of the slash) interacts with the bass note (right side of the slash). Consider A/E. An A chord contains three notes: A, C#, and E. C# is the 6th of E. A is the 4th of E. So, A/E can be thought of as an E6sus4 chord.
