This week I learned that you can emulate Rust's `if let Some(e) ...` [syntax]
in C++.

[`std::optional`] has pointer semantics -- meaning it has an `operator bool`
[overload]. You can use this to limit its scope to a conditional statement just
like `if let Some(e)`

```c++
if (auto opt = ...) {
  /* 
   * opt.has_value() is true! safe to access the underlying value with `value()`
   */
  Foo(std::move(opt.value()))
} else {
  /* opt.has_value() is false! */
}
```
