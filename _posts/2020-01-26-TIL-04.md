I started reading [*Pro Git*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.

There's a great quote in the first chapter:
> "As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or Perforce â€” doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool."

This is similar to a sentiment Gary Bernhardt shares in [a blog post](https://blog.extracheese.org/2010/05/why-i-switched-to-git-from-mercurial.html)

> [If] "you'll be spending a lot of time with it; it's worth getting over the initial hurdle of confusion"

I want to take this approach in learning new, *challenging* things.

All that being said, this week I learned:

Git has synonyms:
	- a commit *is a* snapshot
	- `git diff --cached` is `git diff --staged`

`origin` *is* the default remote

There are three states: modified, staged, and committed
