This week I realized that [`Rc`][rc] might be more trouble than it's worth.
When I first started writing [`rlox`][rlox] I reached for `Rc` to emulate
[`jlox`][jlox] as close as possible. Now I'm struggling with the later chapters
of [Crafting Interpreters].

[Crafting Interpreters]: http://craftinginterpreters.com
[jlox]: https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/java/com/craftinginterpreters
[rc]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html
[rlox]: https://github.com/nickrtorres/rlox
