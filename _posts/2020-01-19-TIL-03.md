# More shell I/O redirection

[strace -o >(cmd)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22029171). I'm still wrapping my head around how this works, but it's really cool! 

My understanding is that `>(cmd)` will call `pipe(2)` connecting its standard input to `stdout` of `strace`. 

Writing something like `strace -o >(grep foo) cmd`, will filter the output of `strace` through grep, dumping filtered output to `stdout`. 

You can emulate this behavior by redirecting `stderr` to `stdout` and piping it to grep:

`strace cmd 2>&1 | grep foo` 

As far as I can tell, this accomplishes the same thing as `>(grep foo)`.
