**Stock and flow**. I heard [Max](https://maxistentialism.com) talking about
this on the [Do By Friday after show](https://www.patreon.com/dobyfriday),
where he quoted [Robin Sloan](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890):

> I was an economics major in college, and I’ve been grateful ever since for a

> I think most of all about the concept of stock and flow.

This is how I'm approaching note taking now. Write down everything. Filter it
later.

**Looking forwards and backwards**. The regular expression `(?<!foo)bar` will
match [iff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_biconditional) `bar` is not
preceded by `foo`. Decomposing this a bit, the expression outside of the
parenthesis, `bar`, is the sequence of characters to look ahead / behind of.
The expression within the parenthesis, `?<!foo`, is the sequence of characters
to look ahead / behind for.

```
>>> re.search('(?<!foo)bar', ' foobar') is not None
False
>>> re.search('(?<!foo)bar', ' bazbar') is not None
True
```

is life' that was never used.
