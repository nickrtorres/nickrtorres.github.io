## Looking ahead

I wanted to iterate over a sequence of characters. Notably, I wanted to peek
ahead at times without advancing the iterator. The standard library has a
[`Peekable`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/struct.Peekable.html) iterator
to look forward without advancing the iterator. Perfect.

```rust
use std::str::Chars;

struct Foo<'a> {
    chars: Chars<'a>,
}

impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
    pub fn new(s: &'a str) -> Self {
        Foo { chars: s.chars() }
    }

    pub fn bar(&self) {
        if self.chars.peekable().peek().is_some() {
            self.baz();
        }
    }

    pub fn baz(&self) {
        self.chars.next();
    }
}
```

As you might imagine, this doesn't work. `peekable` takes an iterator by
`value`. `Foo::bar` takes `self` by shared reference.

                         be borrowed as mutable

## A way out

Stepping back to the original problem:
> I wanted to peek ahead **at times**

So what I really want is an *`iterator`* that can `peek`. Sounds a lot like
`Peekable`.

Since `Peekable` is an iterator, it provides a `next`, `has_next`, etc. APIs in
addition to its '`peek` API. 
```rust
use std::iter::Peekable;
use std::str::Chars;

struct Foo<'a> {
    chars: Peekable<Chars<'a>>,
}

impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
    pub fn new(s: &'a str) -> Self {
        Foo {
            chars: s.chars().peekable(),
        }
    }

    pub fn bar(&mut self) {
        if self.chars.peek().is_some() {
            self.baz();
        }
    }

    pub fn baz(&mut self) {
        self.chars.next();
    }
}
```

This took me a long time (and a [half-baked reimplementation of
`Peekable`](https://github.com/nickrtorres/charstream)) to figure out. I was
convinced holding a `Chars` iterator in `Foo`was the right move.
