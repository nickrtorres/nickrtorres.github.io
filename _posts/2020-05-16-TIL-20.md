This week I found a [visual Brainfuck interpreter][fuck].

This week I noticed a difference in ownership semantics between Java and Rust.

In the [*Block syntax and semantics*][ci] section of Crafting Interpreters, Bob
implements block execution with some help from Java's GC.
```java
void executeBlock(List<Stmt> statements, Environment environment) {
  Environment previous = this.environment;
  try {
    this.environment = environment;

    for (Stmt statement : statements) {
      execute(statement);
    }
  } finally {
    this.environment = previous;
  }
}
```

`previous` is an alias to the current objects environment. A few lines later,
the current object's environment is reassigned to the method parameter
`environment`. Java's GC doesn't chomp up the *old* environment since
`previous` is still holding a reference to it. This means restoring the current
object's `environment` to `previous` is safe.

The story is a bit different in Rust. The programmer must be explicit with their
intentions since the ownership model is more strict.  To *emulate* Java's GC [I
leaned on][rlox] Rust's [Rc][rc] type.

```rust
fn execute_block(&mut self, statements: Vec<Stmt>, environment: Environment) -> Result<()> {
    // Things get a bit weird here. jlox leans on Java's GC to do this.  We
    // need to explicitly reference count our original `environment` so it
    // doesn't get dropped when we *move* it.
    let previous = Rc::clone(&self.environment);

    self.environment = Rc::new(environment);
    for statement in statements {
        self.execute(statement)?;
    }

    self.environment = previous;

    Ok(())
}
```

`previous` is assigned to a reference counted instance of the current struct's
`environment`. This is imperative since the next line *drops* the old
environment (decreasing the reference count by 1). While this is a difference in
the memory model between Java and Rust, I think it's equally a difference
between the assignment operator in both languages (an implicit reference in
Java and an explicit move in Rust).
