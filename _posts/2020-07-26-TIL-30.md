This week I learned more about `*args`.  I was using `subprocess.run` to execute a shell command and I didn't want to type out the individual arguments. 

The [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run) say
> Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return a CompletedProcess instance.

So what if I pass in the arguments as an array?

```python
cmd = 'find . -name foo'
subprocess.run(cmd.split())
```

Sure enough, this works.
