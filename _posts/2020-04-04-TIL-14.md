**Options, results, combinators, and clippy**

The rust standard library provides two types for representing when a value is present
or absent (or an error). These types are [`Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html) and [`Option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html).
In general a lot of things can go wrong all the time. `Result` and `Option` provide ways to react to success and failure.

Consider a function called `cmd()` that returns the name of the running process. For now, we'll stub out `cmd()` to return an empty `ffi::OsString`.
```rust
fn cmd() -> ffi::OsString {
    ffi::OsStringString::new()
}
```

Rust provides [`env::current_exe()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.current_exe.html) to get a `Result<PathBuf>` who's `Ok(T)`
variant contains the *full path* of the current process.  This is a nice affordance, however, we really just want the name of the process. Fortunately,
`PathBuf` has a [`file_name()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.PathBuf.html#method.file_name) method who's `Some(T)` variant gets exactly what
we want. Combining the two looks something like this:
```rust
fn cmd() -> ffi::OsString {
    env::current_exe().unwrap().file_name().unwrap()
}
```

This kind of accomplishes what we want, however, we've introduced two potential `panic!`s. This is where
`Option` and `Result` come in. Recall that `env::current_exe()` returns an `io::Result<PathBuf>`.
Our first call to `unwrap()` elides the error case of getting the name of the current executable.
Let's not do that by returing an `io::Result<ffi::OsString>` instead.
```rust
fn cmd() -> io::Result<ffi::OsString> {
    let cmd_path = env::current_exe()?;
    Ok(cmd_path.file_name().unwrap().to_os_string())
}
```

A little better, but we're still calling `unwrap()`; let's take a closer look at `file_name()`.

Recall that `PathBuf::file_name()` returns an `Option<&OsStr>` where `Some(T)` represents the file name of
the current `path::PathBuf` and `None` represents a `path::PathBuf` that ends in "..". This is almost what we
want, however, it's an `Option<T>`, not a `Result<T,E>`. At this point we need to make a decision: Do we care about the error?
Or do we just care about presence or absence of a value? For this example we'll implement the latter. This
means we need a way to convert `cmd_path` into an `Option<T>` instead of a `Result<T,E>`. Luckiliy, `Result<T,E>` provides
`ok()` to adapt a `Result<T,E>` into an `Option<T>`.
```rust
fn cmd() -> Option<ffi::OsString> {
    let cmd_path = env::current_exe().ok()?;
    let cmd = cmd_path.file_name()?;
    Some(cmd.to_os_string())
}
```

We did it. We have an API that represents success and failure of getting the name of the process.
Naturally, there are other ways to do this. In `cmd()` we're handling all errors with the [`?` operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html).
`Option<T>` and `Result<T,E>` provide combinators to chain `Result`s and `Option`s together: operating on the respective variants
of each.
```rust
fn cmd() -> Option<ffi::OsString> {
    env::current_exe()
        .ok()
        .as_ref()
        .and_then(|p| p.file_name())
        .map(|c| c.to_os_string())
}
```

This implementation accomplishes the same thing as the previous one but with combinators instead of the `?` operator.
[`and_then`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.and_then) and [`map`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.map)
operate on the `T` held by a `Some(T)` `Option<T>` variant. For this post I'm not going to go into more information on combinators;
[Andrew Gallant](https://github.com/BurntSushi) has a great [post](https://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling/) showing the power
of `Result`, `Option`, and `combinators`.

**An aside on `ok()`**

In both implementations we adapted a `Result<T,E>` into an `Option<T>` with `ok()`. When I first learned about adapting `Result<T,E>`s into `Option<T>`s I overlooked `ok()`.
Instead, I wrote the following:
```rust
fn cmd() -> Option<ffi::OsString> {
    let cmd_path = env::current_exe().map_or(None, Some)?;
    let cmd = cmd_path.file_name()?;
    Some(cmd.to_os_string())
}
```

While this accomplished the same thing (and is similar to how the [standard library implements `ok`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/result.rs.html#394-399),
it's a lot more verbose than a simple call to `ok()`. I recently opened a [pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/5415)
on [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) to catch this reimplementation of `ok()`.
