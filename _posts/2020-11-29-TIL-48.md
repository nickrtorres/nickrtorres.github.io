This week I learned that bugs that manifest during the linking phase are still
hard to track down. Can you spot the bug?

```c++
struct Base {
  virtual ~Base() = default;
  virtual void Foo() = 0;
  virtual void Bar() = 0;
  virtual void Baz();
};

struct Derived final : public Base {
  void Foo() final override {}
  void Bar() final override {}
  void Baz() final override {}
};

struct Client {
  Base *ptr = nullptr;
};

int main() {
  Derived d;
  Client client{&d};
  (void)client;
  return 0;
}
```

...`Base::Baz` isn't pure virtual so `ld` is looking for (and failing to find)
an implementation for `Baz` in `Base`. Marking `Base::Baz` pure virtual solves
the problem.
