There is a [blog series](https://os.phil-opp.com) on writing an operating
system in Rust.

[motion](https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#motion.txt) is really powerful.

Passing by value and then moving into an instance variable will incur the cost
of copy and move construction.
```
$ cat moves.cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Foo
{
    Foo() = default;
    Foo(Foo &) { std::cout << "Copy construction" << std::endl; }
    Foo(Foo &&) { std::cout << "Move construction" << std::endl; }
};

struct Sink
{
    Sink(Foo f) : _f(std::move(f)) {}
    Foo _f;
};

int main()
{
    Foo f;
    Sink s(f);
}
$ c++ -std=c++11 moves.cpp
$ ./a.out
Copy construction
Move construction
```

Member functions can be [rvalue or lvalue reference
qualified](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/member_functions).
