This week I learned about state machines and AWK.

The [AWK book][1] gives an example of parsing multiline records with a simple
state machine.

> accountant
> Adam Smith
> 1234 Wall St., Apt. SC
> New York, NY 10021
>
> doctor - ophthalmologist
> Dr. Will Seymour
> 798 Maple Blvd.
> Berkeley Heights, NJ 07922

> lawyer
> David w. Copperfield
> 221 Dickens Lane
> Monterey, CA 93940

> doctor - pediatrician
> Dr. Susan Mark
> 600 Mountain Avenue
