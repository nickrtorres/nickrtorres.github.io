This week I learned about state machines and AWK.

The [AWK book][1] gives an example of parsing multiline records with a simple
state machine.

> Dr. Will Seymour

Pretty neat.

I wrote a [small program][2] to parse a hard-to-read html page into plain text in
just a few lines of AWK using this technique.
