This week I learned...

...you play jazz [on the eighth notes][jazz].

...a *tritone* is three whole steps (*tri* == three; *tone* == whole step).

...a secondary dominant chord is the dominant chord of any chord in the key
(I-vi).

...perfect voice leading is when you keep common tones the same between chords
and you move non-common tones as little as possible.
