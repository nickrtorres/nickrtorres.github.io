This week I learned there are three primitive operations for regular
expressions:

1. Union (Alternation)
2. Concatenation
3. Closure (Star, Kleene Closure)

I _think_ you can define a regular expression for _any_ DFA using these
primitives. Does this means that everything else is sugar for these primitives
(e.g. `?`, `+`, etc.)?
