I learned all of this from Jim Blandy and Jason Orendorff's book,
[Programming Rust](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040385.do).

Consider an enum with a single variant that hold a shared reference to `str`:
```rust
enum OperatingSystem<'a> {
    Unix(&'a str)
}
```

This lifetime is read as "OperatingSystem::Unix can live for *any given lifetime 'a*". That is,
`OperatingSystem::Unix` may live until its referent is destroyed.

The following lifetime is permissible since `edition` is destroyed after `OperatingSystem::Unix`:
```rust
fn main() {
    let edition = String::from("7th edition");
    let os = OperatingSystem::Unix(&edition);

    match os {
        OperatingSystem::Unix(e) => println!("Unix -- {}", e),
    }
}
```

Conversely, the following will fail to compile since `OperatingSystem::Unix` outlives `edition`:
```rust
fn main() {
    let os: OperatingSystem;
    {
        let edition = String::from("7th edition");
        os = OperatingSystem::Unix(&edition);
    }

    match os {
        OperatingSystem::Unix(e) => println!("Unix -- {}", e),
    }
}
```
