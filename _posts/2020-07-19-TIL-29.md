This week I learned more about trait bounds. I was writing a bit of code in
[`rlox`] to walk through the inheritance tree and figured I'd try using a trait and
generics.

```rust
struct RecursiveStructure {
    name: &'static str,
    next: Option<Box<RecursiveStructure>>,
}

struct Walker<'a> {
    current: Option<&'a RecursiveStructure>,
}

impl RecursiveStructure {
    fn new(name: &'static str, next: Option<Box<RecursiveStructure>>) -> Self {
        RecursiveStructure { name, next }
    }

    fn walker(&self) -> Walker {
        Walker {
            current: Some(self),
        }
    }
}
```

Now a `Walk` trait can walk through the references.
```rust
trait Walk {
    type Item;
    fn walk(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}

impl<'a> Walk for Walker<'a> {
    type Item = &'a RecursiveStructure;

    fn walk(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let current = self.current;
        if let Some(cur) = self.current {
            self.current = cur.next.as_deref();
        }

        current
    }
}
```

Now printing the structure is easy.
```rust
impl RecursiveStructure {
    // ...

    fn print(&self) {
        let mut walker = self.walker();
        while let Some(current) = walker.walk() {
            println!("current => {}", current.name);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let head = RecursiveStructure::new(
        "foo",
        Some(Box::new(RecursiveStructure::new(
            "bar",
            Some(Box::new(RecursiveStructure::new("baz", None))),
        ))),
    );

    head.print();
}
```

```

current => foo
current => bar
current => baz
```

Nice. But what if many things in the application are `Walk`. Can `print` be
generic?

```rust
fn print<W>(walker: W)
where
    W: Walk,
{
    while let Some(current) = walker.walk() {
        println!("current => {}", current.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let head = RecursiveStructure::new(
        "foo",
        Some(Box::new(RecursiveStructure::new(
            "bar",
            Some(Box::new(RecursiveStructure::new("baz", None))),
        ))),
    );

    print(head.walker());
}
```

```

`Walk` yields an `Item`. That item can be anything. Adding a restriction on
the item fixes the error.
```
fn print<'a, W>(mut walker: W)
where
    W: Walk<Item = &'a RecursiveStructure>,
{
    while let Some(current) = walker.walk() {
        println!("current => {}", current.name);
    }
}
```

```

current => baz
```

Nice. The `while let Some(...)` syntax is a bit verbose. Can we use a `for`
loop instead? The [`Iterator`] docs say
> Rust's for loop syntax is actually sugar for iterators.

So `Walker` can iterate with a `for` loop if `Walker` is `Iterator`.
```rust
impl<'a> Iterator for Walker<'a> {
    type Item = &'a RecursiveStructure;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.walk()
    }
}

fn print<'a, W>(walker: W)
where
    W: Walk + Iterator,
{
    for current in walker {
        println!("current => {}", current.name);
    }
}
```

```
% cargo run

   |
70 |         println!("{}", current.name);
   |                                ^^^^

```

Same error. The same trick works since Iterator has an associated type too.
```rust
fn print<'a, W>(walker: W)
where
    W: Walk + Iterator<Item = &'a RecursiveStructure>,
{
    for current in walker {
        println!("current => {}", current.name);
    }
}
```

```

current => bar

```

Nice. But now `print` forces the structure to have a `name` field. Making
`Walker` `Display` fixes this issue.
```
impl Display for RecursiveStructure {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
        write!(f, "current => {}", self.name)
    }
}

impl Display for Walker<'_> {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
        match self.current {
            Some(current) => write!(f, "{}", current),
            None => write!(f, "<nothing>"),
        }
    }
}

fn print<'a, W>(walker: W)
where
    W: Walk + Iterator + Display,
    <W as Iterator>::Item: Display,
{
    for current in walker {
        println!("{}", current);
    }
}
```

```

Nice.

## Looking back
The `Walker` struct is probably unnecessary. `RecursiveStructure`
could implement `Iterator` and `IntoIterator` directly. But, in the case of
`rlox`, there's little meaning in calling `next` on a `LoxClass`; it's not
obvious that calling next will yield the next class in the inheritance tree.
Adding a `Walk` trait makes this clearer; Iterating over a `LoxClassWalker`
will yield the classes in the inheritance tree.
