This week I learned a bit more about lifetimes. The following program declares
3 structs: `A`, `B`, and `C`. It uses a single lifetime, `'a`. It does not
compile.

```rust
struct A;

struct B<'a> {
    a: &'a A,
}

impl<'a> B<'a> {
    fn call(&mut self) {}
}

struct C<'a> {
    b: &'a mut B<'a>,
}

impl<'a> C<'a> {
    fn call(&mut self) {}
}

fn main() {
    let mut a = A {};
    let mut b = B { a: &a };
    let mut c = C { b: &mut b };

    c.call();

    b.call();
}
```

`cargo build` fails with the following error.

```
% cargo build
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `b` as mutable more than once at a time

The *problem* is that `C`'s lifetime annotation is too strict.  `C` has an
[exclusive reference] to `B` for `'a`. `B` has a shared reference to `A` for
`'a`.

To conform to C's lifetime annotation, `A` **must** live *at least* as long as
`B`. To conform to B's lifetime annotation, `B` **must** live *at least* as long
as `C`. Applying the [transitive property]: `A` **must** live at least as long as
`C`. Going back to `main`, `A` has a lifetime of main, so `C`'s borrow of `B`
is valid until the end of main.

```
main() {                          Lifetime of A
    let mut a = A {}; <--------------------------+
    let mut b = B { a: &a }                      | Lifetime of borrow
    let mut c = C { b: &mut b }; <---------------+---------------+
                                                 |               |
    c.call();                                    |               |
                                                 |               |
    b.call(); <- b is still exclusively borrowed |               |
} <----------------------------------------------+---------------+


Relaxing the annotations on this program allows it to compile.

```rust
struct A;

struct B<'a> {
    a: &'a A,
}

impl<'a> B<'a> {
    fn call(&mut self) {}
}

struct C<'a, 'b> {
    b: &'a mut B<'b>,
}

impl<'a, 'b> C<'a, 'b> {
    fn call(&mut self) {}
}

fn main() {
    let mut a = A {};
    let mut b = B { a: &a };
    let mut c = C { b: &mut b };

    c.call();

    b.call();
}
```

`C`'s lifetime constraints now allow `B` to be borrowed at `'a` and `A` to be
borrowed at `'b`. Now `C`'s borrow of `B` is indirectly dependent on `'a`. Now
after `c.call()` the compiler can decide if the `c` is still [`live`]. Since it
isn't, it allows `b` to be borrowed mutably again for `b.call()`.

This post is a bit scattered because I still don't completely understand this.
