## Meta
This is the first in a series of TIL posts. Each post will contain a things I learned over the previous week as well as things I donâ€™t really understand. 

## TIL
a closure *closes* over something, capturing the state at its declaration.
consider a C++ lambda:
```c++
int main()
{
    int x = 42;

    auto fn = [x]() { return x; };
    x++;

    assert(43 == x);
    assert(42 == fn());
}
```

`fn` *closes* over x, binding its copy of x to 42. `fn` is not affected by the increment performed on x.

`>` and `<` will indent and unindent text in `vim(1)`. This is much more effective than my previous method of hitting `=` and hoping for the best.

python's tuple unpacking is really nice. For a while I was writing code like this:

```python
def foo(x, y):
	print(f'({x},{y})')

pair = (1, 0)
foo(pair[0], pair[1])
```

python's tuple unpacking simplifies this by allowing:

```python
foo(*pair) 
```

Ken Thompson wrote Unix in 3 weeks; one week for the shell, one week for the editor, one week for the assembler[^1].

## I still donâ€™t understand
C++ Type erasure. Well I understand type erasure, at least in the context of providing a type for a lambda, but it still seems like it will always require heap allocation. Maybe I need to watch [Arthur O'Dwyer's talk] (https://youtu.be/tbUCHifyT24) again.
