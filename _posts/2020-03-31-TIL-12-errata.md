Turns out there's a much simpler way to [read lines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.BufRead.html#method.lines) from something that is `BufRead`.
`BufRead` provides an API to iterate over the lines of a Reader. While the examples in [#12](https://blog.nickrtorres.com/til/2020/03/28/TIL-12.html)
still illustrate the point I was making, a simpler implementation is provided below for brevity:

1. Static polymorphism
```rust
fn print_lines<T: BufRead>(b: &mut T) -> Result<(), io::Error> {
    for line in b.lines() {
        println!("{}", line?);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

2. Dynamic polymorphism
```rust
fn print_lines(b: &mut dyn BufRead) -> Result<(), io::Error> {
    for line in b.lines() {
        println!("{}", line?);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```
