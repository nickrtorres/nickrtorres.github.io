After putting it off for too long, I finally started digging into the `vim(1)` manuals. Naturally, I've already learned a ton. Including a few new tricks that will antiquate old (, bad) habits.

`:g[lobal]/{pattern}/[cmd]` performs `cmd` on lines that match `pattern`. This is handy for sorting `#include` statements: `:g/^#include/sort`

`{visual}J`: the `vim(1)` analogue to python's `join()` method. I used to do this by visually selecting some text, then running `:'<,'>s/\n//g`; hitting `J` is much faster.
